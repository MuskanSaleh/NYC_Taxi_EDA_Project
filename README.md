# NYC_Taxi_EDA_Project
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) data. It includes data cleaning steps, visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn, and a Tableau dashboard displaying taxi trips by month on a New York City map. The project aims to uncover insights into taxi ridership patterns.
